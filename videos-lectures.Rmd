# Videos of lectures

The first two weeks of class lecture will be recorded using Zoom and posted to Panopto.

After the first lecture I will distribute the Panopto folder where the videos will be saved.

Note: Since this class is not meant to be taken asynchronously I will not actively support use of these videos.
