# Zoom {#zoom}

I will use Zoom for recording my lectures and posting them to Panopto but will not release the link for watching the lecture off-site.

Each student can take 1 regular unit exam remotely during the scheduled exam period.  You must contact me ahead of time to do this.

The final exam must be taken in-person.



<!-- Class will be in-person and streamed live via Zoom the first two weeks.   -->
