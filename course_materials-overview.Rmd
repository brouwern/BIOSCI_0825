# Course materials 

Thanks to an open educational resources (OER) grant from the state of Pennsylvania there is no text to purchase for this course.  **All readings will be provided as webpages or PDFs.**  

Most readings will be based on chapters from the book [*Ecology for All!*](https://bio.libretexts.org/Courses/Gettysburg_College/01%3A_Ecology_for_All).
