# Partial credit

Most assignments will be automatically cradeds by Canvas or TopHat.  The system for awarding partial credit depends on whether its Canvas or Tophat, and the type of question.  I try to indicate how a question will be graded, but I do not in the gradebook override how each of these programs assign partial credit.
