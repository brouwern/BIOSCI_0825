# Exam Revision & Review Policies 

* The Friday after an test, an Exam Re-work homework will be assigned. (aka "Exam revision") 
* The Exam Re-work assignment may contain all questions on the test, or be based just on the most missed and hardest questions of the preceding test. 
* You will be free to discuss the Exam Re-work Homework with anyone, including the UTAs.
* However, I will not discuss the test/test revision with anyone until after the test revision is due.
* Test Re-work Homeworks are due the next Monday at 11:59 PM.
* Test Re-work homework *are* graded for correctness.
* I will release a key to the test only after the Test Revision Homework has been graded and record a video where I review the most-missed questions.
* Your lowest Test Revisions score will be dropped.  This calculation will not be done until after finals.
