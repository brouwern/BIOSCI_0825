# Masks and COVID-19

During this pandemic, it is extremely important that you abide by the public health regulations, the University of Pittsburgh’s health standards and guidelines, and Pitt’s Health Rules. 

These rules have been developed to protect the health and safety of all of us.  Universal face covering is required in all classrooms and in every building on campus, without exceptions, regardless of vaccination status. This means you must wear a face covering that properly covers your nose and mouth when you are in the classroom. If you do not comply, you will be asked to leave class.  It is your responsibility to have the required face covering when entering a university building or classroom. For the most up-to-date information and guidance, please visit [coronavirus.pitt.edu](coronavirus.pitt.edu). and check your Pitt email for updates before each class.
