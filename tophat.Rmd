When logging into TopHat it will ask you for your university.  Typing in "University of Pittsburgh" brings up 3 options: **select the first one** that just says "University of Pittsburgh".


If this is your first time using TopHat see [Joining TopHat](https://canvas.pitt.edu/courses/106737/pages/joining-tophat?module_item_id=2272350) for more information.
