# Tests

## General Test policies & Information:

1. Tests will be administered in-class but taken on Canvas.
1. There will be 4 exams semester.  1 will be dropped as detailed elsewhere in the syllabus.
1. I will not answer questions during the test.  This is my normal policy during my other classes, and also is in line with COVID social distancing policies.
1.  Though I do not currently plan on doing this, I reserve the right to require anyone with an accommodation (e.g. DRS, quarantine) to take the test remotely to log into Zoom and have your camera on while taking tests.
