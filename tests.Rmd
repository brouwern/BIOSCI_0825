# Exams

## General exam policies and information:

1. Tests will be administered in-class but taken on Canvas.
1. There will be 3 unit exams semester.  Your **2** highest scores will be used to calculate your final grade.
1. I will not answer questions during exams.  This is my normal policy during my other classes, and also is in line with COVID social distancing policies.


<!-- 1.  Though I do not currently plan on doing this, I reserve the right to require anyone with an accommodation (e.g. DRS, quarantine) to take the test remotely to log into Zoom and have your camera on while taking tests. -->
