# Extra credit policies {#extracredit}

Extra credit will be made available at times; I will decide when to do it.  Requests for extra credit opportunities are likely to be ignored. I will not come up with extra credit assignments on a person-by-person basis.


<!-- "Buffer questions" on the mini-tests (detailed elsewhere) and the final are NOT extra credit. -->

<!-- Exam revision assignments are not extra credit and do not add points to your test score. -->
