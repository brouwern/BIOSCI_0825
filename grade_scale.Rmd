**Note**: Students planning to major in Biological Sciences must pass this course with a C (not C- !) or better.  Rounding is not done until final grades are computed and is done by computer to 1 decimal place. 

Final letter grades are assigned after rounding and is done automatically by Canvas including the decimal value. For example, a score of 91.99% rounds to 92.0% and is an A, but a score of 91.94% rounds to 91.9% and is an A-.
