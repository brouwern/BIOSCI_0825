# Assessment overview

The primary form of assessment in the course will be 3 regular unit exams and a semi-cumulative final that combines information from Unit 4 and the previous units.

<!-- Each test will cover about 4 1/2 weeks of materials. -->

Approximately 75% of your grade will be based on these tests.  See the course point breakdown for the exact number.

Other forms of assessment include

* Assignments
* "In-class" participation through TopHat.  (All in-class assignments will remain open for 24 hours)


<!-- * **Exam re-works**  that allow you to review the tests (these count as assignments and do not add points to your exam) -->
<!-- * Numerous short "micro-quizzes" within lectures to build vocab and test comprehension -->

As detailed elsewhere in the syllabus a portion of each of these individuals components of your grade will be dropped to accommodate illness or other personal issues.  You do not need to submit information (e.g. from a doctor) when you miss an assignment or test.

Sometimes assignments or questions will be marked as being based partially or entirely scored for participation.  These assignments ARE required - "for participation" does NOT mean optional. 

Occasionally, fully optional assignments worth 0 points will be released - these will be clearly marked as worth 0 points and for practice only.

The syllabus will take you step-by-step through all the policies related to these elements of the course.
