# FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

<!-- ## “How will this class be run day-to-day?” -->

<!-- Class will be 100% online with pre-recorded lectures, online quizzes, assignments, and tests, live-streamed recitation sessions (also recorded), and instructor and undergraduate UTA office hours via Zoom.  Below is an outline of each component -->

<!-- Readings:  Readings for each week will be posted in advance.  There will also be a detailed outline of the book indicating focal sections, figures, etc.  See below for information on the textbook. -->
<!-- Lectures:  On Tuesday and Thursday mornings lecture modules will be released.  The core part of the module will be about 65 to 75 minutes of pre-recorded videos, each about 8-15 minutes long.  Each video will be accompanied by a set of slides, information on related readings, and a list of vocab and key concepts.   These questions will be worth points but you’ll be able to revise your answers.  Lecture videos and slides will remain active throughout the course, but questions will close down ~48 hours after they are released (TBD).   -->
<!-- Recitations:  On Fridays we’ll have recitations, with 50-70 students “attending” each recitation.  Most recitations will be a live-streamed problem-solving activity involving small group work.  Most recitations have a digital “worksheet” where answers to the questions discussed in class are submitted.  All recitations will be recorded and all recitation-based assignments can be completed outside of your assigned recitation time. -->
<!-- Problem Sets & Assignments There will be regular problem sets and short assignments - often one to prepare you for recitation and a follow-up to recitation. -->
<!-- Tests: Tests will be online and be taken during the regular class meeting time.  Exact details TBD. -->
 

## “What textbook will we use?”

There is no textbook to purchse - I will provide all readings via Canvas.


## "What content is asynchronous?"

No content will be asynchronous.  Any in-class assignments can be submitted for up to 24 after class for full credit.


<!-- ## “What if I get sick this semester?” -->

<!-- In general, for my courses I use a “drop your lowest 2 scores” policy where -- regardless of the reasons -- your lowest 2 score on each major part of your (tests, assignments, etc) gets dropped.  Thks should accommodate an extended period of illness.   A formal policy for illness and dropping scores will be in the final syllabus. -->

 

<!-- ## “What if YOU get sick this semester?” -->

<!-- All of my materials have been prepared far enough in advance that I will be able to keep the course running even if I get sick. -->

 

<!-- ## “What topics will we be covering?” -->

<!-- The course covers molecular biology, genomics, evolution, and ecology.  We'll start out with Chapters 13, 14, 15, 16, and Appendix B over the first several weeks.   -->



## “I’m not arriving until after the 1st day of class - is that a problem?”

No problem at all.  You can attend from wherever you are via zoom or watch the recordings.  All in-class assignments can be completed up to 24 hours after they are assigned.
 

## “I joined the class late, what can I do?”

All "mini-quiz" questions associated with the Unit 1 lectures will remain open for an extended period of time to accommodate people who join the class later.
