# Lecture slides

Lecture slides will usually be provided as Google Slides, though at times it will be necessary for you to just take notes without access to the slides.   

Google slides can be converted to PDF and PowerPoint using File -> Download. 

Slides I release will typically be a subset of the slides I actually use and it is your responsibility to take notes during each lecture.

When slides are made available prior to lecture I will post them by 10 am the morning of lecture.
