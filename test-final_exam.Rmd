# Final exam

The final exam will ...

1. Take place during finals week on the day scheduled by the University
1. Be administered in-person using Canvas
1. Follow the general format of the unit tests, including having buffer points.

<!-- 1. Potentially improve your grade on another test (see policies elsewhere in the syllabus). -->
<!-- 1. The final exam is NOT one of the 4 unit tests and NOT one of the 3 of those tests that count towards your grade. -->

Note: I do not hold office hours during finals week.

 

Questions on the final exam will be of similar difficulty as the regular unit tests.

<!-- I can only provide estimated grades prior to the exam.  -->
