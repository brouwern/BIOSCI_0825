Approximately 75% of your grade will be based on these tests. See the course point breakdown on Canvas for the exact number. Other forms of assessment include Short assignments and problem sets completed out of class In-class participation through TopHat In-class worksheets, submitted as photos via TopHat As detailed elsewhere in the syllabus a portion of each of these individuals components of your grade will be dropped to accommodate illness or other personal issues. You do not need to submit information (e.g. from a doctor) when you miss an assignment or test. Sometimes assignments or questions will be marked as based partially or entirely scored for participation or completion. These assignments ARE required - “for participation” does NOT mean optional. Occasionally, fully optional assignments worth 0 points will be released - these will be clearly marked as worth 0 points and for practice only.

If multiple people show up I will alternate between them to answer their questions. If I feel I have answered your main questions I may ask that we table our discussion to cover other questions. Note: During finals week I do not hold office hours and am not available for appointments. During office hours, specific questions are better than vague ones, even if it’s just “I specifically don’t understand Fig. 4 in this chapter.” A question like “I don’t understand natural selection” is harder for me to work with.

"],["rounding-numeric-responses.html", "Topic 26 Rounding numeric responses 26.1 How to round like a biologist", " Topic 26 Rounding numeric responses I frequently require numeric answers on assignments and tests. I always include a buffer to accommodate reasonable variation in rounding, and re-check these questions before posting grade. For example, if the answer is 1.05, a typical buffer would allow answers from 1.044 to 1.064 to be accepted as correct. If you believe you entered a correct numeric answer but the buffer was too narrow you can submit a test-inquiry form as detailed elsewhere in the syllabus. 26.1 How to round like a biologist I will often include reminders or instructions about rounding, but may not always do this. Partial credit will not be assigned if you fall outside the buffer or do not follow the stated rounding rules or the general principles below. In general, it acceptable to round to two digits after any initial zeros to the right of the decimal place. Examples: 1.05 is left as 1.05 1.052 is left at 1.052 1.0545 is rounded to 1.055 1.05409999 is rounded to 1.054 When doing calculations round your answer only at the very end. If you need to round intermediate numbers, rounding to the first 4 non-zero digits to the right of the decimal should be ok.

Read the assigned readings before the lectures. Read slowly and thoroughly, but taking notes isn’t necessary. Familiarize yourself with the vocabulary terms and look up unfamiliar words. Read the figure captions in the book and walk through the illustrations. I recommend taking notes by hand with pen and paper or on a tablet during lecture. If possible, print out the slides and fill in key information during class. Review your notes at least briefly after a short time after the lecture. As soon as possible, fill in any gaps with information from the book, other suggested study resources, reviewing lecture recordings, or office hours, etc. Study with a partner or small study group, perhaps using Zoom. Attend office hours, even if it’s just to listen to what other people are asking. Try not to study for long, uninterrupted periods of time without a significant break. Two half-hour or 45-minute study sessions are better than one marathon 1-2 hour session. Ask for help when necessary - before you fall behind. Go to office hours as often as necessary. The UTAs and I are here to help!

In my lectures I will flag information as “background” or “not on the test” when necessary. In general I don’t require you to memorize numbers or dates, and any exceptions will be clearly marked. I also don’t require you to remember the names of people (e.g. famous scientists) or events in their lives. The only standing exception to this is Charles Darwin - any time I talk about Darwin’s life its important. Any other exception will be clearly noted. In contrast, vocab is very important. Unless stated otherwise all vocab is important and could be on the test. 29.1 Your notes are your best study Given the above, when preparing for the tests the best study guides are your notes from lecture. 29.2 Exam study guides Exam study guides MAY be made available before each test but these study guides are in no way complete, comprehensive, or representative.
