I always include a buffer to accommodate reasonable variation in rounding, and re-check these questions before posting grade. For example, if the answer is 1.05, a typical buffer would allow answers from 1.044 to 1.064 to be accepted as correct. If you believe you entered a correct numeric answer but the buffer was too narrow you can submit a test-inquiry form as detailed elsewhere in the syllabus. 26.1 How to round I will often include reminders or instructions about rounding, but may not always do this. Partial credit will not be assigned if you fall outside the buffer or do not follow the stated rounding rules or the general principles below. In general, it acceptable to round to two digits after any initial zeros to the right of the decimal place. Examples: 1.05 is left as 1.05 1.052 is left at 1.052 1.0545 is rounded to 1.055 1.05409999 is rounded to 1.054 When doing calculations round your answer only at the very end. If you need to round intermediate numbers, rounding to the first 4 non-zero digits to the right of the decimal should be ok.

"],["how-to-succeed-in-this-course.html", "Topic 28 How to succeed in this course", " Topic 28 How to succeed in this course Below are some suggestions on how to take on this challenge. Have confidence – you can learn the material! Read the assigned readings before the lectures. Read slowly and thoroughly, but taking notes isn’t necessary. Familiarize yourself with the vocabulary terms and look up unfamiliar words. Read the figure captions in the book and walk through the illustrations. I recommend taking notes by hand with pen and paper or on a tablet during lecture. If possible, print out the slides and fill in key information. Review your notes at least briefly after a short time after the lecture. As soon as possible, fill in any gaps with information from the book, other suggested study resources, re-watching the appropriate video, information from the discussion boards or office hours, etc. Study with a partner or small study group, perhaps using Zoom. Attend office hours, even if it’s just to listen to what other people are asking. Try not to study for long, uninterrupted periods of time without a significant break. Two half-hour or 45-minute study sessions are better than one marathon 1-2 hour session. Ask for help when necessary - before you fall behind. Go to office hours as often as necessary. The UTAs and I are here to help!

Information about the final exam schedule for the University can be found here: https://www.registrar.pitt.edu/students/final-exams. What if I have more than one final exam on the same day?

In general I don’t require you to memorize numbers or dates, and any excepts will be clearly marked in my slides. I also don’t require you to remember the names of people (e.g. famous scientists) or events in their lives. The only standing exception to this is Charles Darwin - any time I talk about Darwin’s life its important. Any other exception will be clearly noted. In contrast, vocab is very important. Unless stated otherwise all vocab is important and could be on the test. 30.1 Study guides Given the above, when preparing for the tests the best study guides are: Lecture slides Your notes Exam study guides MAY be made available before each test but these study guides are in no way complete, comprehensive, or representative.

There will be 4 tests administered throughout the semester. The final exam will be cumulative. No makeup exams will be given for any reason. Your lowest scores of the 4 mini-test will be automatically dropped when grades are calculated at the end of the semester. Additionally, your score on the final can replace your 2nd lowest score, if the final is higher. If your score on the final is lower it does not lower your previous test score. Your grade will therefore be based on your 4 best scores plus the final; 1 of those 4 can be modified by the final, so the final can count twice. If you are unable to take a unit test for ANY reason it will be counted zero. If you miss just 1 test, that score will be automatically dropped as your lowest score when grades are calculated after the final. If you miss 2 tests, 1 will be dropped and the 2nd can be replaced by your score on the final. If you miss 3 tests, the 3rd zero will remain a zero. If this occurs please contact your advisors to consider your options. 31.2 Test length &amp; format NOTE: the following policies are provisional and may be adjusted as needed to optimize test length and how to implement the “buffer question” policy in Canvas. Tests will be scored out of 25 points. However, there will be at least 27 points worth of questions on the test. Each test therefore will effectively contain 2 or “buffer points” that you can miss without harming your grade. The maximum score on a mini-test will always be capped at 25/25. If there are 27 points on a test and you get all 27 questions correct your score will be 100%. No extra credit will be offered on tests; the maximum score on a test will be 100%. 31.3 Test question formats Test questions will frequently be multiple choice. Keyword: “frequently” - there will other types of questions too. Most tests will have at least one question requiring a numeric calculation. Other common forms of questions are fill in the blank, dropdowns, or matching. There will likely NO True/False questions on tests. For fill-in-the-blank questions, spelling errors will result in 0 points. No partial credit will be given.
