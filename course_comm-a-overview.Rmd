# Course communication - Overview

## Primary modes of communication

**All important details will be sent via Canvas messages and mentioned/discussed in class.**  

It is your responsibility to regularly check Canvas messages to stay abreast of the course.  Most communication will occur on Fridays, but important updates may be sent out at other times.
